# Data
### The dataset can be downloaded at http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing#

# Code
### All the experiments are conducted with Python in Jupyter Notebook. 
### You can run the codes block by block to realize my results and it shows my logic about data preparation and parameter-tuning clearly. 
### Please make sure that all the python libs required are prepared.
### The only one place that you need to edit is the root for data because I load it with absolute root on my laptop.

## If you come up with any problems, feel free to contact me at ygao467@gatech.edu.
